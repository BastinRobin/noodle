This cache can be configured in the `noodlejs/lib/config.json` file.

noodle includes an in memory cache for both queried pages and the query 
results to help with the speed of requests.

This cache is included in noodle not at the web service level but lower down 
in the noodle library.

Caching is done on a singular query basis and not per all queries in a request. 
By default the page and results individual items have a life time of an hour. 
With a cache itself having total size of 124 recorded items in memory at one 
time. A cache is also cleared entirely on a weekly basis.

These values can all be changed from noodle's json config.

## HTTP caching headers

The noodle web service includes `Expires` header. This is always set to the 
oldest to expire query result in a result set.

Take not however that the browser [may not cache](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/626057/is-it-possible-to-cache-post-methods-in-http) POST requests to the noodle server.
