&#8291;<span class="project-name">This document</span> shows a complete set of markdown elements and any additional html and class attributes needed to test the CSS.

Adding a higlighted project name
--------------

The text <span class="project-name">"This document" </span> above was achieved by `&#8291;<span class="project-name">This document</span>`. Unfortunately, you need to add an invisible unicode character `&#8291;` , due to [this bug] (http://groups.google.com/group/pdoc/browse_thread/thread/725e4809de2fcc18)
