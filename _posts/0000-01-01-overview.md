Satya should be used to create Github Pages (websites) for any Dharmafly project.

Satya uses [Satya-cli](https://github.com/dharmafly/satya-cli) to generate a local website from your project documentation (if it's stored as markdown files within a `docs` folder). 

This generated site is automatically transformed by [Jekyll] (https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a publically viewable site whenever your project's documentation branch is pushed to GitHub.


<h2><a id="what-does-this-project-satya-contain" class="permalink">&#8205;</a>What does this project contain?</h2>
This project comprises two branches: `master` and `gh-pages`.

The `master` branch contains an empty project web site used by Satya-cli.

The other branch, [`gh-pages`] (https://github.com/dharmafly/satya/tree/gh-pages) contains this working Dharmafly project website template (which also acts as a project documentation).
