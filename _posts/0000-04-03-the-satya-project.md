<h2><a id="upgrading-a-satya-website" class="permalink">&#8205;</a>Upgrading a Satya website</h2>

Using the command line tool, Satya-cli, run `satya upgrade` from your working branch.

(If you do not have the command line tool see the [guide in the wiki] (https://github.com/dharmafly/satya/wiki/Manually-upgrading-a-project-website))

Changes made to the Satya project won't automatically be reflected in projects previously created using the code in this repository and the github pages facility.

There's currently no facility to automatically update all instances of Satya with bugfixes. An [issue exists] (https://github.com/dharmafly/satya/issues/8) for this enhancement.

There's no process yet to do this easily, but [this issue outlines the process required to generalise adding new page levels](https://github.com/dharmafly/satya/issues/1)

If the language exists as an icon, please see [changing the language icon] (#changing-the-language-icon). 

If not, you can update Satya and [create a new icon to be available to all projects] (https://github.com/dharmafly/satya/wiki/Adding-a-new-language-icon-to-the-sidebar)
