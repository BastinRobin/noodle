The server can accept scraping queries in 2 ways:

### with JSONP

You can send a URI encoded blob of json for the `q` querystring key.

`http://dharmafly.nsql-example.com?q=<JSONBLOB>&callback=?`

If you are unable to stringify JSON you can still use the querystring to make 
one query (but not multiple).

    jQuery.param(query);
    // eg. url=http%3A%2F%2Fchrisnewtn.com&selector=ul.social+li+a&extract%5B%5D=text&extract%5B%5D=href

### with POST

You can also POST your query as json (`application/json`) to the noodle server. 
This is preferable if your request is too large or you're talking to noodle from 
another server. However the browser [may not cache](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/626057/is-it-possible-to-cache-post-methods-in-http) these requests.
