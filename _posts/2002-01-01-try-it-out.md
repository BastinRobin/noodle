Below is an ace editor where you can edit your code.  

Here are some tips for you to get started with your experiment.  

1. Find a web document you like
2. Figure out the data you think would be easy to extract
3. Figure out the appropriate CSS or [JSONSelect]() Selector
4. Write the noodle `query`.
5. If your query is going against a json document change the 
type property to `"json"` and you may ommit the `"extract"` 
property.

Press run to see the output:

    var server = "http://dharmafly.noodle-example.jit.su/",
        query = {
          url: "http://chrisnewtn.com",
          type: "html",
          selector: "ul.social li a",
          extract: ["text", "href"]
        },
        request;

    request = server + '?q=' +
              encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(query)) +
              '&callback=?';

    jQuery.getJSON(request, function (data) {
      console.log(data);
      demoElement.innerHTML = JSON.stringify(data);
    });
