Below is an ace editor where you can edit your code.  

Here are some tips for you to get started with your experiment.  

1. Find a website you like
2. Find some data you think would be easy to extract
3. Figure out its appropriate CSS Selector
4. Write the NSQL JSON Query!  

 
    var server = "http://dharmafly.nsql.jit.su?",
        query = {
          url: "http://chrisnewtn.com",
          selector: "ul.social li a",
          extract: "text" // can also be array
        },
        jsonUrl;

    jsonUrl = server + jQuery.param(query) + '&callback=?';

    jQuery.getJSON(jsonUrl).then(function (data) {
      $output.append(JSON.stringify(data));
    });
