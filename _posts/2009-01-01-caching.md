Noodle internally has its own caching for both results and requested pages.

## The result cache

Caching is done on a singular query basis and not per request. An individual 
query is cleared every hour. The cache itself has a total size of 124 (default) 
recorded queries and associated results in memory. 

The entire cache is cleared on a weekly basis by default.

If a result object has a `created` field this signifies that it has been cached.
Failed queries such from 404 errors will not be cached.

## The page cache

Noodle uses a seperate cache object for requested pages. Both caches have different configurations which can be set in `lib/config.json`.

## HTTP caching headers

The `Expires` header is set to the oldest to expire query in a result set.

Take not however that the browser [may not cache](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/626057/is-it-possible-to-cache-post-methods-in-http) POST requests to the noodle 
server.
