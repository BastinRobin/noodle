Below is an ace editor where you can edit your code.  

Here are some tips for you to get started with your experiment.  

1. Find a website you like
2. Find some data you think would be easy to extract
3. Figure out its appropriate CSS Selector
4. Write the nsql JSON `query`  

Press run to see the output:

    var server = "http://dharmafly.nsql-example.jit.su/",
        query = {
          url: "http://chrisnewtn.com",
          selector: "ul.social li a",
          extract: ["text", "href"]
        },
        request;

    request = server + '?q=' +
              encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(query)) +
              '&callback=?';

    jQuery.getJSON(request, function (data) {
      console.log(data);
      demoElement.innerHTML = JSON.stringify(data);
    });

The nsql server also supports JSON over HTTP POST.
