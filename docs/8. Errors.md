noodle aims to give errors for the possible use cases were a query does 
not yield any results.

Each error is specific to one result object and are contained in the `error` 
property as a string message.

Response:

    {
      "results": [],
      "error": "Page not found"
    }

noodle also falls silently with the `'extract'` property by ommitting any 
extract results from the results object.

Consider the following JSON response to a partially incorrect query.

Query:

    {
      "url": "http://chrisnewtn.com",
      "selector": "ul.social li a",
      "extract": ["href", "nonexistent"]
    }

Response:

The extract "nonexistent" property is left out because it was not found
on the element.

    {
      "results": [
        {
          "href": "http://twitter.com/chrisnewtn"
        },
        {
          "href": "http://plus.google.com/u/0/111845796843095584341"
        }
      ],
      "created": "2012-08-01T16:28:19.167Z"
    }

If the selector is invalid or none of the extract rules match up then you 
will receive an empty array.

Query:

    {
      "url": "http://chrisnewtn.com",
      "selector": "ul.social li a",
      "extract": ["nonexistent", "nonexistent2"]
    }

Response:


    {
        "results": [],
        "created": "2012-08-01T16:26:39.734Z"
    }
