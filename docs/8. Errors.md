nsql fails silently and assumes error handling to be handled by the client side.
Consider the following JSON response to a partially incorrect query.

Query:

    {
      "url": "http://chrisnewtn.com",
      "selector": "ul.social li a",
      "extract": ["href", "nonexistent"]
    }

Response:

The extract "nonexistent" property is left out because it was not found
on the element.

    {
        "results": [
            {
                "href": "http://twitter.com/chrisnewtn"
            },
            {
                "href": "http://plus.google.com/u/0/111845796843095584341"
            }
        ],
        "created": "2012-08-01T16:28:19.167Z"
    }

If the selector is invalid or none of the extract rules match up then you will receive
an empty array.

Query:

    {
      "url": "http://chrisnewtn.com",
      "selector": "ul.social li a",
      "extract": ["nonexistent", "nonexistent2"]
    }

Response:

    {
        "results": [],
        "created": "2012-08-01T16:26:39.734Z"
    }
