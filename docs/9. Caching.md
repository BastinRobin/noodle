Caching is done on a singular query basis and not per request. An individual 
query is cleared every hour. The cache itself has a total size of 100 recorded 
queries and associated results in memory. These time values can be changed in 
`lib/config.js`.

If a result object has a `created` field this signifies that it has been cached.
Failed queries such from 404 errors will not be cached.

## HTTP caching headers

The `Expires` header is set to the oldest to expire query in a result set.
