Caching is done on a singular query basis and not per request.

Cache is cleared every hour and has a total size of 100 recorded queries and 
associated results in memory. This is specified in `lib/cache.js` .

If a result object has a `created` field this signifies that it has been cached.
Failed queries such from 404 errors will not be cached.

A more sophisticated cache module is planned.
