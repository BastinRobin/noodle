Caching is done on a singular query basis and not per request.

An individual query is cleared every hour. The cache itself has a total size of 
100 recorded queries and associated results in memory. 

These time values can be changed at the top of the `lib/cache.js` script.

If a result object has a `created` field this signifies that it has been cached.
Failed queries such from 404 errors will not be cached.

A more sophisticated cache module is planned.
