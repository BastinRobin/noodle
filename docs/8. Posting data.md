noodle allows for post data to be passed along to the url target server. This 
done with the optional `post` property which takes an object map.

    {
      "url": "example.com/login.php",
      "post": {
        "username": "john",
        "password": "123"
      },
      "select": "h1.username",
      "type": "html"
    }
